SKEPTICAL
<br>
Introduction<br>
Brief description of the design philosophy of your language.<br>
Skeptical is a structured, English-like programming language designed to be highly readable and verbose like COBOL, while incorporating the scoping mechanism Python. It uses indentation to define blocks, supports lexical scoping, and encourages a top-down, procedural style of development<br>
Discussion of the languages that influenced your language design.<br>
The purpose of Skeptical is to offer the readability and documentation-style syntax of COBOL, with Python’s modern ease of use through dynamic typing, lexical scoping behavior and comparison operators. We also implement const variables and type “locking” to allow for better memory management and easier debugging.<br>
Design Influences<br>
Cobol-Structure, division-based organization, focuses on forms.<br>
Python- Scoping, simplicity, indentation-based syntax, lack of required type declarations.<br>
